                        I launched my career as a UX designer in 2022, fresh out of Lancaster University with a Design
                        Degree under my belt. Since then, I've been deeply entrenched in the tech realm, contributing my
                        expertise to a leading Cambridge-based applied Machine Learning company.

                        Working hand in hand with engineers, I've become an advocate for lean UX practices. By
                        seamlessly integrating these methods into agile development teams, I champion continuous
                        delivery, ultimately enhancing user experiences.

            <p class="font-bold">why design?</p>
            <p class="pt-xs">My journey into design began long before university. I had a deep passion for art, finding
                excitement in every creative endeavor. I even took my GCSE art a year early, earning an A* grade, and
                continued through to A levels. When it came time to apply for university, I stumbled upon a course I'd
                never heard of - Design. Until then, I'd only associated design with physical products or interiors,
                never considering its digital realm. However, as I delved into the course specifications, I had a
                revelation - design offered an opportunity to creatively solve problems.

            <p class="font-bold">why ux/ui design?</p>
            <p class="pt-xs">After stepping into the world of design at University, I was determined to become an
                exceptional problem-solver, leveraging my creative skills to address both user and business challenges.
                In my second year, I enrolled in a module called Interaction Design, marking my first introduction to
                User Experience (UX) and Interface Design. Through this module, I delved into the intricacies of
                interaction design. Continuing my exploration, I advanced to the next level in my second year, immersing
                myself in the advanced module. It was here that my path became clearâ€”I knew I wanted to pursue a career
                as a UX designer.
